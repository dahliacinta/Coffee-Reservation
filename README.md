## Project Overview
The growth of small catering businesses has increased the need for an efficient reservation system, as many businesses still rely on manual bookings through phone calls or walk-ins. This often leads to issues such as lost reservations, pricing miscalculations and double bookings.

To address these problems, the Coffee Catering Reservation System was developed for Lands & People Cafe. This web-based system simplifies the reservation process by allowing users to choose predefined coffee catering packages based on their budget and event requirements.

---

## Project Objectives
- To digitalize the reservation process by replacing manual phone-based booking with an online platform.
- To provide users with a seamless reservation experience for selecting packages and entering event details.
- To enhance user satisfaction by enabling users to view, update, and cancel bookings.


---

## Target Users
- **Customers:** Individuals booking coffee catering services  
- **Owners:**  Owners who want to manage bookings effectively digitally

---

## Features and Functionalities
- Home page showcase: Display service offered such as professional baristas, fresh - ingredients, handcrafted drinks, event catering, and mobile coffee.
- Package display: Shows the fixed package coffee menu and pricing.
- Online reservation form: Let users input personal and event details.
- Date picker calendar: Allows users to select dates easily.
- Booking status page: Shows whether users have active bookings or not.

** Laravel Implementation

- Routes (Web.php)

Route::name('home');

// Move booking store route outside auth middleware
// (allow guests to submit, but check in controller)
Route::post('/bookings', [BookingController::class, 'store'])
    ->name('bookings.store');

Route::middleware([
    'auth:sanctum',
    config('jetstream.auth_session'),
    'verified',
])->group(function () {

    // Other booking routes (protected - require login)
    Route::get('/bookings', [BookingController::class, 'index'])
        ->name('bookings.index');

    Route::get('/bookings/{booking}/edit', [BookingController::class, 'edit'])
        ->name('bookings.edit');

    Route::put('/bookings/{booking}', [BookingController::class, 'update'])
        ->name('bookings.update');

    Route::delete('/bookings/{booking}', [BookingController::class, 'destroy'])
        ->name('bookings.destroy');

    Route::get('/packages', function () {
        return view('packages');
    })->name('packages');
});
